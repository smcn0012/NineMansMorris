# NineMansMorris
An implementation of NMM with basic AI.  This project was part of the FIT3077 subject at Monash.  My teammates were Alex Kenellis and Matthew Finis.  The highlight for me of this project is my implementation of the AI.  I managed through creating some, at times, convoluded heuristics to make an decent AI that I am confident is able to beat most beginer players and some intermediate players.

My AI is in ./main/Players/AiPlayer.java
